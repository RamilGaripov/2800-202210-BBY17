Week 4 Milestone (iteration):
Responsive design:
The admin page, walk, and hike, are still lacking proper styling.

TIMELINE(80%):
User is able to go to the timeline page.
Timeline creates a post every time a user completes an activity. To see the posts, users need to go to the timeline page.
Users are able to see what game they played and when they completed it(though the date formatting requires a fix) and also add comments about those experiences.


Admins can no longer see everyone's password, but they can reset users passwords to a default value.
Users are able to upload a profile picture on the profile page. 


Uncompleted requirements:
It's still possible to delete all the admins.
Users are still unable to add/update pictures on their posts.
